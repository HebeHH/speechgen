Welcome to this yoga nidra body scan meditation. Find a comfortable position lying down, either on your back on a yoga mat, or in your bed. Take a moment to adjust your body, ensuring your spine is straight and your limbs are relaxed. You may want to place a small pillow under your head, and cover yourself with a light blanket to stay warm during the practice.

[Pause for 15 seconds]

Begin by taking several deep breaths to settle in. Breathe in through your nose, filling your lungs completely, and exhale slowly through your mouth. With each exhale, feel your body becoming heavier, sinking deeper into the surface beneath you. Notice how your breath moves your body - the rise and fall of your belly, the expansion of your ribcage, the subtle movement in your shoulders.

[Pause for 45 seconds]

Now, focus on lengthening your breath. Inhale for a count of four, feeling the cool air enter your nostrils. Hold the breath gently for a count of two. Exhale for a count of six, feeling the warm air leave your body. Hold empty for a count of two. Continue this rhythm - inhale four, hold two, exhale six, hold two.

[Pause for 1 minute]

Let your breath return to its natural rhythm. Imagine a wave of relaxation flowing through your entire body. With each inhale, this golden light of relaxation fills you with peace. With each exhale, any tension or stress melts away. Let this wave wash over you again and again, from the crown of your head to the tips of your toes.

[Pause for 1 minute]

Feel your entire body resting in space. Notice the points of contact between your body and the surface beneath you - your heels, calves, thighs, buttocks, back, shoulders, and head. Feel the weight of gravity drawing you downward, anchoring you to the earth.
