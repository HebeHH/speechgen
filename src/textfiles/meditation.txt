Welcome to this yoga nidra body scan meditation. Find a comfortable position lying down, either on your back on a yoga mat, or in your bed. Take a moment to adjust your body, ensuring your spine is straight and your limbs are relaxed. You may want to place a small pillow under your head, and cover yourself with a light blanket to stay warm during the practice.

[Pause for 10 seconds]

Begin by taking a few deep breaths to settle in. Breathe in through your nose, filling your lungs completely, and exhale slowly through your mouth. With each exhale, feel your body becoming heavier, sinking deeper into the surface beneath you.

[Pause for 30 seconds]

Now, imagine a wave of relaxation flowing through your entire body. With each inhale, this wave of relaxation fills you with peace. With each exhale, any tension or stress melts away. Let this wave wash over you again and again, from the crown of your head to the tips of your toes.

[Pause for 1 minute]

We'll now begin our body scan. Bring your awareness to the top of your head. Notice any sensations in your scalp - perhaps tingling, warmth, or pressure. There's no need to change anything, simply observe the sensations present.

Let your awareness flow down to your forehead. Feel it becoming smooth and relaxed. Notice your eyebrows softening, your eye sockets releasing any tension. Your eyes can rest heavily in their sockets.

Move to your jaw, allowing it to release and soften. Your tongue can rest gently in your mouth, and your lips can part slightly. Feel your entire face becoming peaceful and serene.

[Pause for 30 seconds]

Bring your attention to your neck and throat. Notice any tension here and allow it to dissolve with each breath. Feel the back of your neck lengthening and relaxing.

Now move to your shoulders. Observe any holding or tightness here. With each exhale, let your shoulders become heavier and more relaxed. Feel this relaxation flow down your upper arms, past your elbows, through your forearms, into your wrists, hands, and fingers.

[Pause for 45 seconds]

Bring your awareness to your chest and upper back. Feel the gentle rise and fall of your breath here. Allow your ribcage to soften and release. Let this relaxation spread through your middle back and into your lower back.

Move to your ankles, letting them become soft and relaxed. Feel this relaxation flowing into your feet - through the tops of your feet, your soles, your heels, and finally into each toe individually.

[Pause for 45 seconds]

Now, become aware of your entire body as one unified field of sensation. Feel the connection between each part, the gentle pulsing of life throughout your form. Rest here in this state of complete relaxation.
